    "All preprocessing was implemented using **fMRIPrep** (Esteban et al., 2018), which includes anatomical T1-weighted brain extraction, anatomical surface extraction, head-motion estimation and correction, susceptibility-derived distortion estimation and unwarping, intrasubject registration, and spatial normalization (intersubject registration). All volumes were registered to the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) standard template. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD time series in MNI space and the resulting data was smoothed using a 6.0 mm^3 FWHM Gaussian kernel and the time series was scaled within voxels to represent percent signal change.\n",
